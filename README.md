</div>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Your <code>hosts</code> file, located in <code>/system/etc</code>, acts like your school blocking service that prevents access to certain websites. However, this (<code>hosts</code> file) operates locally on your phone's root system.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>How does it block websites?</strong><br>
          The <code>hosts</code> file blocks websites and malware by denying your phone access to connect to them entirely. It simply returns a blank page, e.g., <code>0.0.0.0 www.the-website-that-is-blocked.com</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Modifications made to the hosts file:</strong><br>
          The <code>hosts</code> file was sourced from a reliable provider. Four separate files were merged into one comprehensive file to block spyware, malware, and ads. This combined file now blocks over <strong>800,000+</strong> harmful and annoying websites.
        </li>
      </ul>
